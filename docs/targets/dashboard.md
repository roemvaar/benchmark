* Kvaser CAN to USB adapter (x2)
* Host PC with build tools

## Software

### Host

### Target

The RPi4 is the target.

* Automotive Grade Linux for RPi4
* Application that accepts CAN commands

## AGL

Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) is an open source project by the Linux Foundation. It is an open source operating system 
and development framework for automotive applications.

## Raspberry Pi

Single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. All models feature a Broadcom system on a chip
(SoC) and ARM CPU. Highly used for project demonstrations. In this demo, we are using a Raspberry Pi 4.

## AGL for Raspberry Pi 4

There are two main ways to get AGL running on a Raspberry Pi, the first one is to get the source code and build
it on a host machine, the other option is to get a precompiled version. After an image is obtained by any of these
two ways, this image needs to be stored on a flash drive. Check the following image for instructions on how to flash
the micro sd card:

For booting the images, you just plug the SD card into the Pi slot, power the board and see the AGL with the help of an external monitor.
